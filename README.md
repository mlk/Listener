Factorio Manager
================

Factorio Manager is part of my [factorio-aws-chatops](https://github.com/mlk/factorio-aws-chatops) project.

It is work in progress and may (will) change drastically as I work out the right way of doing stuff.

*NOTE:* This is my 'Learning Go' application. This code may well be absolutely flipping awful. I'm very
likely using a Object Oriented model where one is not wanted. Feel free to tell me how awful the code
is via the medium of pull requests.
